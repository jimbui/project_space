// project_space notes.

// general notes.

// questions.

// to-do list.

	classify rooms (S , M , L , XL , SP) for ship design.
	clarify on ship roles (what role(s) does each ship fufill?).

// ship design.

	ship classification. // two types of ships , civilian ships and military ships.
	
		civilian. // trade and production oriented , light combat.
		
			// standard ships.
		
			escape pods.
				- smallest object , can have multiple from same ship.
			passenger / transport ships.
				- meant to transport people around.
			construction / work ships.
				- mining ships , building ships , research ships , science , surveryors , etc.
			transport freighters.
				- small / medium ships meant for transporting goods.
			cargo ships.
				- large ships for transporting goods.
				
			// misc.
			
			hydroponics-ship.
				- grows food.
				- acts as a store in space?
			space ads.
				- like stellaris , giant billboards in space.
				
		military. // combat oriented , heavy combat.
		
			// light and escort ships.
		
			fighters / bombers / drones.
				- smallest combat ships.
				- does not have inside view.
				- launced from carrier ships only.
				- 1 to 2 people.
				- drones controlled by central AI mainframe.
			transport ships / assault ships.
				- transport personnel.
				- can be combat oriented , like for boarding enemy ships.
			corvettes.
				- smallest ship-of-the-line.
				- light patrol duty.
				- escort for larger ships.
			frigates.
				- slightly larger than corvettes.
				- light / medium patrol duty.
				- escort for larger ships.
			
			// start of captial ships.
		
			carriers.
				- has many sizes (small carriers for patrol to super-carriers for fleet operations).
				- only ship that carry fighters.
				- fighters are long ranged.
				- ship is lightly armored.
				- few weapons.
				- fragile.
			destroyers.
				- ship meant for close quarter combat.
				- heavily armed and armored.
			cruisers.
				- ship meant for long / medium ranged combat.
				- has more utility than a destroyer , but not as armored and less weapons.
			battleship.
				- larger version of a destroyer.
			battlecruiser.
				- larger version of a cruiser.
			dreadnought.
				- largest warships.  not many of these exist.
				- super OP.
				- one per empire?
				
	ship modules. // a conceptual idea for now.
		
			all ships have standarized room sizes.  the rooms can be switched out to other rooms of the same size.  there 
		are some modules that a critical to a ship and cannot be replaced or moved.
		
		// critical modules.  
		
		power source / core.
			- provides power for the ship.
		engine room.
			- provides movement for ship.
		bridge / control room / cockpit.
			- provides control of the physical ship.
		life support.
			- maintains air , oxygen , and temperature.
			
		// utility modules.  these rooms provide a feature or purpose.
		
		combat information centre (CIC) / operations room.
			- tactical / command centre of the ship.  
			- manages combat logistics and information , as opposed to the bridge that only controls the ship.
			- additional radar and sensors.
			- galaxy chart
			- provides combat bonus.
			-upgradable to radar jamming.
		shield-generator.
			- provides shields for the ship.
		special-weapons.
			- giant laser.
			- nuke launcher.
			- EMP.
			- flamethrower.
		hanger.
			- provides a place for fighters to dock.
			- repairs fighters.
			- only on carrier ships.
		cargo bays.
			- allows for storage of goods.
		brig.
			- allows for prisoners to be stored.
		gun deck.
			- location of the guns.
			- crews can operation gun.
			- AI can operate gun if available.
			- players can manually operate the gun.
		AI mainframe.
			- contains the core of the AI.
			- allows for usage of the AI (point-defense , operation of guns , etc).
		armory.
			- contains small guns for crew usage.
		munitions room.
			- contains torpedoes , missiles , ammo , and other weapon related materials. 
		science / research lab.
			- allows for special anomolies to be detected / investigated.
		medical room
			- for troops to be healed.
		
		// misc rooms.  just to look pretty.  maybe have small bonus?
		
		recreation room.
		trash room.
		crew quarters.
		galley.
		meeting rooms.
		gym.
		showers.
		airlocks / blast doors.
		library
		pool
		
// station design.
	Civi stations 
		- colony stations
		- trading stations - dockable
		- shipyards
		- research stations 
		- hotel
		- communications
	Military
		- Outposts - small stations for monitors.
		- Basic military stations, S-L
		- Main command
		- military shipyard - must be part of faction.
		- supplying depot
		
		
// sounds. // henry's got this.

	sound effects.
	music.
	voices.

// storyline.

	main story.
	side missions / tasks.
	random events.

// weapons design.

	kinetic - good against shields
		- basic cannon, shoot faster when upgrade.
		- long range, heavy hitting, sniper.
	laser  	- good against armor
		- basic cannon, shoot faster when upgrade.
		- long range, heavy hitting, sniper.
		- beam laser
	missle 
		torpedos - long range, slow faced, easier to dodge.
		regular missles - closer range, hit smaller ships.

	shields 
		- hardshell,
// targeting
	FTL like targeting.
		- all guns have 1,2,3...4 buttons.
		- select different target, press button.
